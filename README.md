# Plant Disease Recognition with CNN

This project is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify plant leaves as either healthy or dry. It was developed as a college assignment during the fifth semester to demonstrate basic image classification with deep learning.

**Note:** The trained models and image datasets have been removed from this project due to their large size. However, training the model using the provided code achieves approximately **93% accuracy**.
